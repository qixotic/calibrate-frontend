/**
 * Pareto-frontier helper for the benchmark leaderboard scatter chart.
 *
 * Models are compared on three objectives: **cost** (lower is better), **pass
 * rate** (higher is better) and **latency** (lower is better). A model A
 * *dominates* model B when A is no worse than B on every objective and strictly
 * better on at least one — i.e. A is at least as cheap, at least as accurate AND
 * at least as fast as B, while beating it on price, score or speed. The Pareto
 * frontier is the set of models that no other model dominates: the "efficient"
 * choices where any improvement on one axis costs you on another.
 *
 * Latency is optional. When either model in a pairwise comparison is missing a
 * finite latency, the latency axis is dropped for that pair and dominance falls
 * back to cost vs pass rate — so a run with no latency data behaves exactly like
 * the two-objective frontier.
